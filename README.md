A bridge between CollabVM and Discord
## How to run
There are 2 ways to run this bot:
1. replace `process.env.TOKEN` in the last line of `index.ks` with your token in quotes (like this: `client.login("your-token-here");`)
2. run the bot without changing `index.js`, but set environment variable `TOKEN`
